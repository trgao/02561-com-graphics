a. Phong lighting is the lighting model that describes how light interacts
with a surface at a specific point, and can be used with other shading methods
like Gouraud shading to interpolate the colours. Phong shading is the shading
technique that applies the lighting model on every pixel of the object. <br>
<br>
b. Flat shading calculates the lighting for each surface using only a single normal,
so the color is uniform across the surface and there is no interpolation. Gouraud
shading calculates the lighting for each vertex of the surface and then interpolating
it across the surface to make it appear smooth. Phong shading calculates the lighting
for each pixel by interpolating surface normals across the surface. <br>
<br>
Flat shading:<br>
Pros: Fast and easy to compute and works well for flat surfaces<br>
Cons: Low realism, no smooth shading and realistic highlights<br>
<br>
Gouraud shading:<br>
Pros: Smooth shading and still relatively efficient compared to Phong shading<br>
Cons: Things like specular highlights may not be rendered properly, and it can<br>
fail to capture subtle lighting details on surfaces<br>
<br>
Phong shading:<br>
Pros: Most accurate and smooth shading, and accurate highlights<br>
Cons: Slower and computationally more expensive due to calculation at every pixel<br>
<br>
Phong shading is best for simulating highlights, as highlights are more accurate due 
to calculation at every pixel compared to calculation at every vertex for Gouraud
shading or calculation at every surface for flat shading. <br>
<br>
c. A directional light is treated as a light source infinitely far away that emits light
in 1 direction only, with parallel light rays hitting the object and same light intensity
on the object. A point light has a specific position in space and emits light in all
directions, with intensity of light decreasing as object moves further from light.<br>
<br>
d. Eye position will influence the shading of an object, as the specular reflection
component in the Phong reflection model is dependent on the angle between direction of
perfect reflection and the direction of the observer. <br>
<br>
e. The object will no longer have specular highlights, and it will not have a glossy appearance. <br>
<br>
f. Increasing shininess component will cause specular reflection to be more concentrated and brighter, 
so the specular highlights will be smaller but more intense.<br>
<br>
g. Eye space.
