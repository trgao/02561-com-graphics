Nearest: blocky and pixelated look of textures as there is no interpolation
does not do much to help with magnification/minification issues
Linear: Smoother texture appearance when magnified due to interpolation,
might still look blocky for minification as values are averaged
Nearest mipmap nearest: Abrupt transitions between different mipmap levels
as there is no interpolation between mipmap levels
Linear mipmap nearest: Smooth texture within a mipmap level, but abrupt transitions
between different mipmap levels as there is no interpolation between mipmap levels
Nearest mipmap linear: Smooth transition between different mipmap levels but no within
a mipmap level
Linear mipmap linear: Smooth transitions between different mipmap levels and
within mipmap levels
