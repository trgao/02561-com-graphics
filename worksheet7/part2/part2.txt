The vertices of the background quad are given in clip coordinates,
which are coordinates in space after applying model-view-projection
matrix transformation to coordinates. Hence, we just need to undo the
model-view-projection matrix transformation to get the original coordinates
of the quad so that we can render.
Hence we just need to inverse the model-view-projection matrix,
inverse(projection * modelView) = inverse(modelView) * inverse(projection)
