Projection shadows:<br>
Pros:<br>
- Much easier to implement compared to shadow mapping<br>
- Much faster and less resources needed to compute<br>
Cons:<br>
- Can only work to project shadows on flat surfaces<br>
- Cannot project shadows onto objects themselves<br>
<br>
Shadow mapping:<br>
Pros:<br>
- Can create shadows of greater complexities compared to projection shadows<br>
- Can cast self shadows<br>
Cons:<br>
- Much more complicated to implement<br>
- Takes more resources to compute shadows<br>
- Shadow aliasing/pixelation<br>
